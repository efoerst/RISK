# RISK
Automated Line Following Car

*The Task* <br />
The RISK project was tasked with utilizing a TI instrument H-Gate car utilizing IR Senssitivity and PID control to follow a line (a.k.a. *track*) as fast as possible.

*Included files* <br />
A *.h* file intializes IR sensitivity and callibration whilst the *.ino* source code tells the car to follow the track until the end, complete a perfect 180 degree turn, and follow the track back to it's origin.
